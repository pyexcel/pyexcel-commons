If your company has embedded pyexcel and its components into a revenue generating
product, please `support me on patreon <https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=5537627>`_ to
maintain the project and develop it further.

If you are an individual, you are welcome to support me too on patreon and for however long
you feel like to. As a patreon, you will receive
`early access to pyexcel related contents <https://www.patreon.com/pyexcel/posts>`_.

With your financial support, I will be able to invest
a little bit more time in coding, documentation and writing interesting posts.
