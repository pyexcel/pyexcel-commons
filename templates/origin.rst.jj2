The idea originated from the common usability problem when an excel file
driven web applications is delivered for non-technical users: such as team assistant,
human resource administrator. The fact is that not all people know the
difference among various excel formats: csv, xls, xlsx. Instead of training those people
about file formats, this library helps web developers to handle most of the excel file
formats by providing a common programming interface. To add a specific excel file format
to you application, all you need is to install an extra pyexcel plugin. No code change
to your application. No issues with excel file formats any more. Looking at the
community, this library and its associated ones try to become a small and easy to
install alternative to Pandas.
